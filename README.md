# Distributed-Peer-to-Peer-System-for-Fractal-Computing
A distributed peer to peer system for computing fractals, with <b>load balancing</b> (generating fractal images). 

## Overview
The peer to peer network is a complete graph where communication between nodes is <b>asynchronous and non-FIFO</b>.<br>
The system can <b>concurrently</b> compute one or more fractals. <br>
When nodes join/leave the network, if it is optimal <b>the system reorganizes (balances) the workload</b>. <br>
The user can request for an image to be generated (the entire fractal, or a specified part of it) using the computed data up until that moment. <br>
The user can also ask for status information of all nodes in the system, which lists all active nodes with their work progress up until that moment. <br>
